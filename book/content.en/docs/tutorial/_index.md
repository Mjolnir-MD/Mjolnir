# Tutorial

## [The Lennard-Jones fluid]({{<relref "lennard-jones">}})

First, the way to define global (a.k.a. non-local) interaction is explained through simulation of the Lennard-Jones fluid.

## [A Gaussian chain]({{<relref "gaussian-chain">}})

Next, the way to define local interaction is explained through simulation of a simple polymer model.
